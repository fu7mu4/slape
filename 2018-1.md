# XMPPFramework for Mac and iOS with GNU IDN Library are not compatible license for AppStore

# SLAPE ID

	2018-1

# Main OSS

	- XMPPFramework for Mac and iOS : released under BSD like License
	https://github.com/robbiehanson/XMPPFramework

# License Details

	- GNU IDN Library : libidn released under GPL v3
	https://www.gnu.org/software/libidn/
	
	- AppStore is seemed not to be compatibled with GPL v2/v3

# Pitfall

	1. Search a library for XMPPFramework by cocoapod
	2. choose XMPPFramework for Mac and iOS
	3. XMPPFramework for Mac and iOS requires libidn
	4. GNU IDN Library is released under GPLv3
	
	Some tools for Acknowledgements.plis cannot collect license notation like a GNU IDN Library that is out side of CocoaPods
	
# WORKAROUND

	1. use ICU's stringprep instead of GNU IDN Library
